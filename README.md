The main objectives of the course are as follows:

1. To introduce the types of processes that are encountered in the chemical industry.

2. To explain the ways of obtaining the necessary thermodynamic properties from the available data.

3. To familiarize with the strategies for systematically determining the unknown information about the "input" and/or the "output" of a process.

4. To introduce the recent advances in the field of chemical process calculations.

Recommended textbooks: 

1) "Elementary Principles of Chemical Processes" by Richard M. Felder and Ronald W. Rousseau

2) "Basic Priciples and Calculations in Chemical Engineering" by David M. Himmelblau and James B. Riggs

Course schedule:

1 lecture per week: Discussion about the fundamental concepts. The information will be updated on this site in advance.

2 tutorials per week: Solving selected problems from the textbook and explaining the strategies. Notes about the strategies will be updated in advance. The problem statements will be provided to the students during the tutorial session.

1 assignment per week: Selected problems that may or may not be from the textbook. These will be emailed to the students every week.

NOTE: The problem statements and solutions are not posted on this webpage to comply with the copyrights (if any) of the authors of the textbooks. Please email at kaustubh [[dot]] rane21 [[at]] gmail [[dot]] com with any queries regarding the content.

IMPORTANT: How to use this repository

1. Most of the notes are included in a single file named "chemical_process_calc.mm" and few notes are provided in the form of PDF documents. The file "chemical_process_calc.mm" is self-explanatory. The ".mm" file format is associated with 'FreeMind' which is a mind-mapping software tool written in JAVA. To view and/or to edit these files, one may use freely available softwares like FreeMind (http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) or Docear (http://www.docear.org/). I recommend Docear because of ease of including equations and references.

2. In order to request edits in the ".mm" files, please create a GitHub account, fork the repository, make changes to a file and submit the pull request to me. The procedure is explained in detail on https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

3. If you are a student taking the course at IIT Gandhinagar, I will recommend creating the GitHub account such that your identity is easily determined.
